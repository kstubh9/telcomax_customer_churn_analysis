## Problem Statement
TelcoMax is a leading telecommunications provider offering a wide range of services including internet, television, and mobile phone plans. Despite a robust customer base, TelcoMax has been experiencing a noticeable rate of customer churn, which is adversely affecting its revenue growth and market position. Understanding the factors contributing to customer churn and identifying strategies to retain customers is crucial for the companyâ€™s long-term success.

TelcoMax aims to reduce customer churn and optimize revenue by gaining insights into the customer journey, identifying key indicators of churn, and developing targeted strategies to improve customer retention. The company is seeking a comprehensive analysis that integrates customer demographics and usage patterns to understand the churn behavior.

### Objectives 
**Analyze Customer Churn**: Determine the overall churn rate and identify customer segments with the highest churn rates.
**Identify Key Indicators**: Pinpoint factors such as tenure, monthly charges, and demographic details (e.g., gender, dependents, senior citizens) that are most strongly associated with churn.
**Evaluate Financial Impact**: Assess the total monthly charges lost due to churn and identify high-value customer segments at risk.
**Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer retention strategies.

### Data Source
**Customer Demographics**: Information about customer age, gender, dependents, senior citizen status, etc.
**Service Details**: Monthly charges and tenure.
**Churn Status**: Indicator whether a customer has churned or not.

The relevant data is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

### DAX Measures
Below are some of the DAX Measures used in the report.

**1. Average Tenure of Churned Customers**
```dax
Average Tenure of churned = CALCULATE([Total Tenure Churned]/[Count of churned])
```

**2. Average Tenure of Non-Churned Customers**
```dax
Average Tenure of Not churned = CALCULATE([Total Tenure Not Churned]/[Count of not churned])
```

**3. Average Monthly Charges of Churned Customers**
```dax
AvgMonthlyCharges_Churned = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(cleaned_telco_churn[monthly_charges]),
    cleaned_telco_churn[Churn] = "Yes"
)
```

**4. Average Monthly Charges of Non-Churned Customers**
```dax
AvgMonthlyCharges_NonChurned = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(cleaned_telco_churn[monthly_charges]),
    cleaned_telco_churn[Churn] = "No"
)
```

**5. Average Tenure of Churned Customers (in Months Format)**
```dax
AvgTenure_Churned = 
VAR Churned = 
    CALCULATE(
        AVERAGE(cleaned_telco_churn[tenure]),
        cleaned_telco_churn[Churn] = "Yes"
    )
RETURN 
    FORMAT(Churned, "0") & " Months"
```

**6. Churn Rate of Customers with Partners**
```dax
Churn Rate of customers having partners = 
DIVIDE([Churned customers having partners], [Total Customers having partners])
```

**7. Churn Rate of Customers without Partners**
```dax
Churn Rate of Customers Without Partners = DIVIDE([Churned customers not having partners], [Total Customers not having partners])
```

## Recommendations
**Enhance Customer Retention Strategies for New Customers:** The churn rate for customers within the first 12 months is extremely high at 47.44%. Implement onboarding programs, provide special offers, and maintain regular follow-ups during the initial months to increase engagement and satisfaction. Consider offering incentives such as discounts or added services to customers who stay beyond the first year.

**Focus on Retaining Senior Citizens:** Senior citizens have a significantly higher churn rate (41.68%) compared to non-senior citizens (23%). Develop targeted retention programs for senior citizens. This could include customized service plans, senior-friendly customer support, and loyalty programs. Regular check-ins and special promotions tailored to senior citizens could also help reduce churn.

**Support and Engage Customers Without Partners:** Customers without partners have a higher churn rate (32.96%) compared to those with partners (19.66%). Design campaigns to engage single customers, such as social events, community building activities, or personalized offers. Understanding the unique needs and preferences of single customers and addressing them can improve retention.

**Address High Churn Among Customers Without Dependents:** The churn rate for customers without dependents is higher (31.28%) than for those with dependents (15.45%). Investigate the reasons why customers without dependents are more likely to churn and develop targeted retention strategies. Consider providing benefits or services that appeal to individuals without dependents.

**Optimize Service Plans for Different Tenure Groups:** Average monthly charges vary significantly across different tenure groups, and churn rates decrease as tenure increases. Regularly review and optimize service plans to ensure they meet the evolving needs of customers as they stay longer. Introduce tiered loyalty programs that reward long-term customers with benefits like discounts, premium features, or exclusive services.

**Implement Strategies to Reduce Churn Among High-Charge Customers:** Churned customers have higher average monthly charges ($74.44) compared to non-churned customers ($61.27). Offer personalized retention programs for high-charge customers. This could include premium support, exclusive offers, or personalized service plans. Identifying and addressing the pain points of high-charge customers can help reduce churn.

**Strengthen Customer Support and Engagement:** The overall churn rate is 26.54%, indicating room for improvement in customer satisfaction and engagement. Invest in strengthening customer support and proactive engagement strategies. Regularly gather feedback, conduct satisfaction surveys, and act on the insights to continuously improve the customer experience. Personalized communication and prompt issue resolution can significantly enhance customer loyalty.

**Gender-Specific Retention Strategies:** The churn rate for female customers is slightly higher (26.92%) than for male customers (26.16%). Develop and implement gender-specific retention strategies. Understand the unique needs and preferences of female customers and address them through tailored communication, offers, and services.
